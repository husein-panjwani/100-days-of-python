# 100 Days of Code - Day 9

## Overview
Welcome to Day 9 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today's projects include a Blind Auction program, a Student Grades calculator, and a Travel Log. These projects reinforced my understanding of dictionaries, functions, and loops in Python.

## Projects

### Blind Auction
This project simulates a silent auction where multiple bidders can place their bids anonymously. At the end of the auction, the program determines and announces the winner.

#### What I Learned
- **Dictionaries**: Using dictionaries to store and manage bidder names and their corresponding bids.
- **Functions**: Creating a function to determine the winner based on the highest bid.
- **Input Handling**: Collecting user inputs for bidder names and their bids.
- **Screen Clearing**: Using `os.system("cls")` to clear the screen between bids for better user experience.

### Student Grades
This project calculates the grades of students based on their scores and assigns a grade category to each student.

#### What I Learned
- **Dictionaries**: Using dictionaries to store and manage student names and their scores.
- **Conditionals**: Applying conditional statements to determine the grade category based on score ranges.
- **Looping**: Iterating over dictionary items to assign grades.

### Travel Log
The Travel Log project allows users to add new countries they have visited, along with the number of visits and cities they visited in those countries.

#### What I Learned
- **Dictionaries and Lists**: Using nested dictionaries and lists to manage and store travel data.
- **Functions**: Creating a function to add new entries to the travel log.
- **Appending to Lists**: Adding new dictionary entries to the existing list of travel logs.

### Additional Resources
- **blind_auction_art.py**: Contains the logo and additional assets for the Blind Auction project.
