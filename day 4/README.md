# 100 Days of Code - Day 4

## Overview
Welcome to Day 4 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I worked on four Python scripts, each focusing on different concepts such as random number generation, matrix manipulation, list operations, and conditional statements. Let's explore what I accomplished and learned.

## Exercises Completed
1. **Coin Toss**: I wrote a script to simulate a coin toss, generating either "heads" or "tails" randomly using the `random.randint()` function.

2. **Treasure Hunt**: Next, I created a script to place a treasure ('T') in a 3x3 matrix based on user input for row and column coordinates. The matrix representation was updated to reflect the location of the treasure.

3. **Random Person Selector**: I developed a script to randomly select a person from a list of names entered by the user. The script outputs the selected person who has to pay the bill.

4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: Lastly, I implemented a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player chooses their move ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') and competes against the computer. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## What I Learned
- **Random Number Generation**: I practiced generating random numbers using the `random.randint()` and `random.choice()` functions to introduce randomness into my scripts.
- **List Manipulation**: I learned how to manipulate lists, including accessing elements, modifying values, and splitting strings into lists using the `split()` method.
- **Matrix Representation**: I explored representing matrices using nested lists and updating specific elements based on user input.
- **Conditional Statements**: I utilized conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of the program and make decisions based on user input or random outcomes.

## Reflection
Day 4 was an engaging day of coding, exploring various Python concepts and practicing problem-solving skills. I delved into random number generation, list manipulation, conditional statements, and interactive user input. By working on these scripts, I gained a deeper understanding of how to incorporate randomness into my programs, manipulate matrices, and create interactive games. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring new challenges as I progress through the 100 Days of Code journey!
