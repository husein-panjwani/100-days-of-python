# 100 Days of Code - Day 12

## Overview
On Day 12 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I developed a number guessing game. This project helped in practicing conditionals, loops, user interaction, and basic game logic.

## Projects

### Number Guessing Game
This project involves creating a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player can choose between two difficulty levels, 'easy' and 'hard', which determine the number of attempts allowed.

#### What I Learned
- **Random Module**: Used the `random` module to generate a random number for the player to guess.
- **Functions**: Created separate functions for handling the game logic based on difficulty level.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied conditionals to provide feedback to the player whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- **Loops**: Utilized loops to manage the number of attempts and keep the game running until the player wins or runs out of attempts.
- **User Interaction**: Implemented user input to get the player's guesses and to select the difficulty level, enhancing user engagement.

## Usage
1. Run the script to start the game.
2. Choose a difficulty level ('easy' or 'hard').
3. Guess the number within the allowed attempts based on the selected difficulty.
4. The game provides feedback whether the guess was too high or too low.
5. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.

## Example
Here's an example of how the game might look during play:
```
welcome to number guessing game!
I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Select difficulty level: easy or hard? easy
You have 10 attempts left.
Make a guess: 50
Too high!
You have 9 attempts left.
Make a guess: 25
Too low!
...
You have 1 attempt left.
Make a guess: 42
You won the game! Good job!
```

Keep pushing through and happy coding!
