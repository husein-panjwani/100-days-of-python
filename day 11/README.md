# 100 Days of Code - Day 11

## Overview
On Day 11 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on creating a simple blackjack game. This project provided hands-on experience with functions, conditionals, loops, and basic game logic.

## Projects

### Blackjack Game
This project involves simulating a simple version of the popular card game, Blackjack. The game allows a player to compete against a computer dealer, following standard Blackjack rules.

#### What I Learned
- **Random Module**: Used the `random` module to simulate drawing cards from a deck.
- **Functions**: Defined functions to handle various aspects of the game, such as dealing cards, calculating totals, and checking for Blackjack.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied conditionals to handle game rules, such as determining the winner, handling Aces, and deciding when the dealer should draw more cards.
- **Loops**: Utilized loops to allow the player to hit (draw another card) or stand (end their turn) and to manage the dealer's drawing logic.
- **User Interaction**: Implemented user input to control the flow of the game and decide whether to play another round.
