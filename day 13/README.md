# 100 Days of Code - Day 13

## Overview
On Day 13 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on reinforcing and revising the concepts and skills learned in the previous days. The day was dedicated to revisiting and practicing core programming fundamentals through various projects.

## Projects

### Prime Number Checker
This project involves creating a function that checks if a given number is a prime number. The function iterates through possible divisors to determine if the number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

#### Key Concepts
- **Loops**: Utilized loops to iterate through potential divisors.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied conditionals to check divisibility and identify prime numbers.

### Paint Calculator
This project calculates the number of paint cans needed to paint a wall of given dimensions, based on a predefined coverage per can.

#### Key Concepts
- **Mathematical Calculations**: Used mathematical operations to calculate the area and the number of cans needed.
- **Functions**: Defined functions to modularize the calculation process.

### Caesar Cipher
This project implements a basic encryption and decryption algorithm using the Caesar Cipher technique. The cipher shifts each letter in the text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

#### Key Concepts
- **String Manipulation**: Used string operations to shift letters and handle encryption/decryption.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Applied loops to iterate through the text and conditionals to handle the shifting logic.

### Silent Auction
This project simulates a silent auction where participants can place bids, and the highest bid wins. It involves collecting and comparing bids to determine the winner.

#### Key Concepts
- **Dictionaries**: Used dictionaries to store bidders and their bids.
- **Loops**: Applied loops to continue collecting bids until the auction ends.
- **Conditional Logic**: Used conditionals to determine the highest bid.

### Student Grades
This project involves creating a dictionary to store student scores and converting those scores into grades based on predefined criteria.

#### Key Concepts
- **Dictionaries**: Used dictionaries to map student names to their scores and grades.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Applied loops to iterate through scores and conditionals to assign grades.

### Travel Log
This project involves maintaining a travel log with details of countries visited, number of visits, and cities visited in each country.

#### Key Concepts
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: Used nested data structures to store travel information.
- **Functions**: Defined functions to add new entries to the travel log.

### Leap Year Checker and Days in Month
This project includes functions to check if a given year is a leap year and to determine the number of days in a specified month, considering leap years.

#### Key Concepts
- **Mathematical Logic**: Used mathematical operations to determine leap years.
- **Lists**: Used lists to store the number of days in each month.
- **Functions**: Defined functions to encapsulate the leap year and days in month logic.

### Simple Calculator
This project implements a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

#### Key Concepts
- **Functions**: Defined functions for each arithmetic operation.
- **Dictionaries**: Used dictionaries to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Applied loops to continue calculations and conditionals to handle user choices.

### Blackjack Game
This project simulates a simple version of the Blackjack card game. It involves dealing cards, calculating totals, and determining the winner.

#### Key Concepts
- **Lists**: Used lists to represent decks and hands of cards.
- **Random Module**: Used the `random` module to simulate card drawing.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Applied loops to handle game rounds and conditionals to determine the game outcome.

### Number Guessing Game
This project is a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range and with a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.

#### Key Concepts
- **Random Module**: Used the `random` module to generate a random number.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Applied loops to manage attempts and conditionals to provide feedback.

## Summary
Day 13 was a valuable opportunity to reinforce the programming fundamentals and concepts learned in previous days. By revisiting these projects, I gained a deeper understanding and improved my problem-solving skills.

Keep pushing through and happy coding!
