# 100 Days of Code - Day 5

## Overview
Welcome to Day 5 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I worked on several Python scripts covering topics such as loop iterations, password generation, finding the highest score, implementing FizzBuzz, and calculating the average.

## Exercises Completed
1. **Sum of Even Numbers**: I wrote a script to calculate the sum of even numbers from 0 to 100 using a for loop.
   
2. **Password Generator**: Next, I developed a password generator script that allows users to specify the length of the password, along with the number of uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers to include.

3. **Highest Score Finder**: I created a script to find the highest score among a series of scores entered by the user.

4. **FizzBuzz Implementation**: I implemented the classic FizzBuzz problem, where the script prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, otherwise prints the number itself.

5. **Average Calculator**: Lastly, I wrote a script to calculate the average of a series of numbers entered by the user.

## What I Learned
- **Loop Iterations**: I practiced using for loops to iterate over a range of numbers and perform operations based on specific conditions.
- **List Manipulation**: I learned how to manipulate lists, including appending elements and shuffling them using the `random.shuffle()` function.
- **User Input Handling**: I improved my skills in handling user input, including parsing strings and converting them into appropriate data types for calculations.
- **Conditional Statements**: I reinforced my understanding of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and their usage in controlling the flow of the program.

## Reflection
Day 5 was a productive day of coding, where I tackled a variety of Python exercises focusing on loop iterations, password generation, score analysis, and arithmetic calculations. These exercises helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts. I'm excited to continue exploring new challenges and expanding my Python proficiency as I progress through the 100 Days of Code journey!
