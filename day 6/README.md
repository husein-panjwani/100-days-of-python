# 100 Days of Code - Day 6

## Overview
Welcome to Day 6 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I focused on logic building and familiarizing myself with functions by completing challenges on the website [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html). I successfully completed Hurdles 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as a maze challenge.

## Apology for Delay
Sorry for the delay in coding updates. I had exams, which took up most of my time and attention. But now I'm back on track and ready to continue my coding journey.

## Activities Completed
1. **Hurdle 1**: I solved the first hurdle challenge, which introduced basic movement commands and obstacle navigation.
   
2. **Hurdle 2**: Next, I tackled the second hurdle challenge, which involved more complex obstacles and movement patterns.

3. **Hurdle 3**: I successfully completed the third hurdle challenge, which introduced additional concepts or challenges to overcome.

4. **Hurdle 4**: Lastly, I conquered the fourth hurdle challenge, which presented advanced obstacles and required creative problem-solving skills.

5. **Maze Challenge**: Additionally, I completed a maze challenge, which tested my ability to navigate through complex paths and reach the goal.

## What I Learned
- **Logic Building**: By completing these challenges, I honed my logic-building skills and learned how to approach problems systematically.
- **Function Familiarity**: I became more familiar with using functions to organize code and perform specific tasks efficiently.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: These challenges helped me develop creative problem-solving strategies and think critically to overcome obstacles.

## Reflection
Day 6 was an exciting and rewarding day of coding as I delved into interactive challenges on Reeborg's World. These exercises not only strengthened my understanding of Python but also improved my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I'm thrilled to continue exploring new challenges and expanding my coding skills as I progress through the 100 Days of Code journey!
