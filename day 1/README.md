## Band Name Generator

Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!

### Introduction
This simple Python script generates a unique band name based on two inputs: the city you were born in and the name of your pet. It's a fun way to come up with a band name if you're feeling stuck or looking for inspiration.

### Instructions
To use the Band Name Generator:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone the `band_generator.py` file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `band_generator.py` is located.
4. Run the script by typing `python band_generator.py` and pressing Enter.
5. Follow the prompts to enter the name of the city you were born in and the name of your pet.
6. The script will then generate a unique band name based on your inputs and display it on the screen.

### What I Learned
- **Basic Input/Output**: You learned how to use the `input()` function in Python to prompt the user for input and the `print()` function to display output on the screen.
- **String Concatenation**: You discovered how to concatenate (join together) strings using the `+` operator in Python.
- **Variable Assignment**: You practiced assigning values to variables in Python using the `=` operator.
- **User Interaction**: You explored how to interact with users by asking for their input and incorporating it into your program's logic.
- **Simple Script Structure**: You created a simple Python script with a clear structure, including importing modules, collecting user input, performing calculations (in this case, string concatenation), and displaying the result.
- **Project Setup**: You may have set up your coding environment, installed Python if it wasn't already installed, and executed Python scripts from the command line or terminal.

### Example
```
Welcome to Band Name Generator!

What is the name of the city you were born in?
New York

What is the name of your pet?
Max

Your band name is New York Max!
```
