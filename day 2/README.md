# 100 Days of Code - Day 2

## Overview
Welcome to Day 2 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I tackled four exercises to practice Python programming. Let's dive into what I accomplished and learned.

## Introduction
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ On Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code journey, I delved deeper into Python programming by working on four exciting exercises. From calculating BMI to building a tip calculator, it was a day filled with coding challenges and learning opportunities. Let's explore what I accomplished!

## Exercises Completed
1. **BMI Calculator**: I created a Python script to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using user-input height and weight values. It prompts the user to enter their height in meters and weight in kilograms, then calculates and displays the BMI.

2. **Two-Digit Number Sum**: Next, I wrote a script to find the sum of the digits in a two-digit number entered by the user. It extracts each digit from the input and adds them together.

3. **Tip Calculator**: For the third exercise, I built a tip calculator. This script takes the total bill amount and the desired tip percentage as input, calculates the total bill including tip, and allows the user to split the bill among multiple people.

4. **Life Left Calculator**: Finally, I created a script to calculate the number of days, weeks, and months left until a person turns 90 years old. The user inputs their current age, and the script calculates and displays the remaining time until they reach 90 years old.

## What I Learned
- **User Input**: I practiced using the `input()` function to prompt users for input and receive values as strings.
- **Data Type Conversion**: I learned how to convert string inputs to numerical data types (e.g., `float` and `int`) using the `float()` and `int()` functions.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: I utilized basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division to perform calculations.
- **String Formatting**: I used string formatting techniques, including f-strings, to create dynamic output messages with variables.
- **Logical Operations**: I implemented logical operations to perform tasks like extracting digits from numbers and calculating percentages.

## Reflection
Day 2 was another productive day of coding! I practiced fundamental Python concepts and strengthened my skills in user interaction, data manipulation, and problem-solving. I'm excited to continue the challenge and see where my coding journey takes me next!
