# 100 Days of Code - Day 8

## Overview
Welcome to Day 8 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I worked on three projects: a Prime Number Checker, a Paint Calculator, and a Caesar Cipher. These projects helped me practice using functions, loops, conditionals, and list manipulations.

## Projects

### Prime Number Checker
This project involves creating a function to check if a given number is prime. It also identifies a divisor if the number is not prime.

#### What I Learned
- **Functions**: Creating and using functions to encapsulate logic.
- **Loops**: Using `for` loops to iterate through potential divisors.
- **Conditionals**: Applying `if` statements to determine primality.

### Paint Calculator
The Paint Calculator helps determine the number of paint cans needed to cover a wall given its height, width, and coverage per can.

#### What I Learned
- **Math Module**: Using the `math.ceil` function to round up to the nearest whole number.
- **Input Handling**: Taking user inputs for height and width.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performing arithmetic operations to calculate the required number of paint cans.

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. This project includes both encryption and decryption functionalities.

#### What I Learned
- **Lists**: Manipulating lists to handle the alphabet and perform the shift.
- **String Manipulation**: Working with strings to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Using loops to iterate through characters in the text and conditionals to handle shifts and non-alphabetic characters.
- **Modulus Operator**: Using the modulus operator to handle shifts larger than the length of the alphabet.
