# 100 Days of Code - Day 10

## Overview
On Day 10 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I tackled projects focusing on date calculations, a simple calculator, and learning about nested data structures. These projects helped solidify my understanding of conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures in Python.

## Projects

### Days in Month
This project determines the number of days in a given month of a specified year, taking into account whether it is a leap year.

#### What I Learned
- **Leap Year Calculation**: Implemented a function to check if a year is a leap year.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied nested conditionals to handle special cases like leap years.
- **List Indexing**: Used lists to store the number of days in each month and accessed the correct value based on the user input.

### Calculator
This project involved creating a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also allows the user to continue calculations with the previous result or start a new calculation.

#### What I Learned
- **Functions**: Defined functions for each arithmetic operation.
- **Dictionaries**: Used a dictionary to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions.
- **Recursive Functions**: Utilized recursion to restart the calculator based on user input.
- **User Interaction**: Implemented a loop to continuously prompt the user for operations and numbers until they choose to exit or restart.

### Additional Resources
- **art.py**: Contains the logo for the calculator project.
