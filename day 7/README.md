# 100 Days of Code - Day 7

## Overview
Welcome to Day 7 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I created a Hangman game using Python. This project helped me practice working with lists, loops, conditionals, and user input.

## Project: Hangman Game
### Description
The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where players try to guess the letters in a word within a limited number of attempts. If they guess a letter correctly, it is revealed in the word. If they guess incorrectly, they lose a life. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of lives.

### What I Learned
- **Random Module**: How to use the `random` module to select a random word from a list.
- **Lists**: How to manipulate lists to track the player's progress.
- **Loops**: Using `while` loops to keep the game running until it ends.
- **Conditionals**: Applying `if` statements to check guesses and update the game state.
- **User Input**: Handling user input to make the game interactive.

### Resources
- **hangman_word.py**: Contains the list of words for the game.
- **hangman_art.py**: Contains the hangman stages and the logo for the game.

Keep pushing through and happy coding!
