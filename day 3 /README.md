# 100 Days of Code - Day 3

## Overview
Welcome to Day 3 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, I tackled multiple Python exercises, including BMI calculation, leap year identification, string manipulation, number classification, pizza ordering, and ticket verification. Let's explore what I accomplished and learned.

## Exercises Completed
1. **BMI Calculator**: I created a Python script to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight inputs. The script then classifies the BMI into different categories: underweight, normal, overweight, obese, and clinically obese.

2. **Leap Year Identification**: Next, I wrote a script to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. The user inputs a year, and the script checks if it meets the criteria for a leap year.

3. **Name Compatibility Checker**: I developed a fun script to check the compatibility of two names by counting the occurrences of specific letters ('t', 'r', 'u', 'e' for "true" and 'l', 'o', 'v', 'e' for "love") in their joint name. The higher the count, the stronger the compatibility!

4. **Odd/Even Number Classifier**: I built a script to classify a given number as odd or even. The user inputs a number, and the script checks if it's divisible by 2 to determine its classification.

5. **Pizza Order Calculator**: I created a script to calculate the total bill for a pizza order based on the size of the pizza (small, medium, or large) and additional toppings (pepperoni and extra cheese). The script prompts the user for their preferences and calculates the total bill accordingly.

6. **Ticket Verification**: Lastly, I implemented a ticket verification system where users input their height and other details to determine eligibility for a free ticket or calculate the bill based on age and student status. Users can also opt for a photo during the ride for an additional fee.

## What I Learned
- **Nested Conditionals**: I learned how to use nested conditional statements to create more complex decision-making processes.
- **Enhanced User Interaction**: By incorporating user input for height, age, and student status, I improved the interactivity and customization of the scripts.
- **Variable Reassignment**: I practiced reassigning values to variables based on different conditions to calculate the total bill accurately.

## Reflection
Day 3 was a challenging yet rewarding day of coding! I tackled a diverse range of Python exercises and expanded my knowledge of conditional statements, string manipulation, and user interaction. By working on these projects, I gained valuable insights into problem-solving strategies and further solidified my understanding of Python fundamentals. I'm excited to continue exploring new challenges and pushing my coding skills to new heights!
